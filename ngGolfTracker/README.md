# NgGolfTracker

GolfTracker is an API used to track stats for rounds of golf with a spin. Instead of a traditional tracker which focuses on bogeys and birdies and general scores, this tracker tracks lost balls, green fees, and beverages consumed; all with the purpose of tracking money spent.

##Description
After a round of golf a user can input their statistics which are stored in a database.
Users can look up rounds by id, update by id, find all rounds, create new rounds or delete rounds.

#Lessons Learned

- ATTENTION TO DETAIL... when you're banging your head against the wall to figure out a problem, don't hesitate to take a step back. Come back with fresh eyes and you'll likely realize the mistake you've made. You'll likely also beat yourself up about it, which is warranted, dummy; but at least you learned a lesson.
- There are multiple ways to get something done. Don't try to solve every hangup with the same strategy.
- Proper preparation for a task save a lot of time. As Abraham Lincoln said "If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.‚Äù
